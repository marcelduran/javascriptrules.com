author: Rafael Coelho

I'm more than pleased to announce that the 3rd generation of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/3/" target="_blank">YUI</a> is finally out, I've been following closely the YUI project ever since I joined Yahoo! almost 4 years ago and since then the framework has evolved incredibly, the 3rd version announced today is a complete redesign, the framework became faster, lighter and easier to use, quoting <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2009/09/29/yui-3-0-0/">Eric Miraglia: </a> <em>"One of the goals of the YUI 3 redesign was to make it easy to use without sacrificing power, performance and configurability."</em>

Go ahead and give it a try, the YUI Blog post is a good starting point <a href="http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2009/09/29/yui-3-0-0/">YUI 3.0.0: First GA Release of YUI’s Next-Generation Codeline</a>
