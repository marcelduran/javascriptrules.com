I'm more than pleased to announce that the 3rd generation of [YUI][1] is finally out, I've been following closely the YUI project ever since I joined Yahoo! almost 4 years ago and since then the framework has evolved incredibly, the 3rd version announced today is a complete redesign, the framework became faster, lighter and easier to use, quoting [Eric Miraglia: ][2] *"One of the goals of the YUI 3 redesign was to make it easy to use without sacrificing power, performance and configurability."*

Go ahead and give it a try, the YUI Blog post is a good starting point [YUI 3.0.0: First GA Release of YUI's Next-Generation Codeline][2]
