After a long period of no posts due to personal issues, I'm back now and alive!  
This time with a new post on [YDN][1] - Yahoo! Developer Network - blog: [Performance on Yahoo! Search for Earth Day][2].  
In this post I describe the performance case study of [Yahoo! Search][3] [Earth Day campaign][4].

During this long off-post period, besides my day job, I've been doing some experiments, developing some tools and brainstorming lots of ideas, mostly related to performance and JavaScript. I do have some post drafts and will be publishing them soon. Here are a few topics I'm covering along this year: 
*   setTimeout minimum delay limit
*   Prefetching CSS images
*   Problems with gradients filters on IE links hover
*   Flipping page direction RTL/LTR easily - [RTLzr][5] a Firefox extension
*   JavaScript Interviews Exposed (series)
*   Lazy Enhancement
*   JavaScript video subtitle
*   JavaScript video timeline marks
*   Deleting a removed node from DOM

Stay tuned!
