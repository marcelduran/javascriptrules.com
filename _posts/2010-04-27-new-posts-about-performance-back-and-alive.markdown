title: New posts about performance. Back and alive!
author: Marcel Duran

After a long period of no posts due to personal issues, I'm back now and alive!
This time with a new post on <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/">YDN</a> - Yahoo! Developer Network - blog: <a href="http://developer.yahoo.net/blog/archives/2010/04/performance_on_yahoo_search_earth_day_data_uri_ftw.html">Performance on Yahoo! Search for Earth Day</a>.
In this post I describe the performance case study of <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Search</a> <a href="http://events.yahoo.com/earthday/2010/">Earth Day campaign</a>.

During this long off-post period, besides my day job, I've been doing some experiments, developing some tools and brainstorming lots of ideas, mostly related to performance and JavaScript. I do have some post drafts and will be publishing them soon. Here are a few topics I'm covering along this year:
<ul>
	<li>setTimeout minimum delay limit</li>
	<li>Prefetching CSS images</li>
	<li>Problems with gradients filters on IE links hover</li>
	<li>Flipping page direction RTL/LTR easily – <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/114416">RTLzr</a> a Firefox extension</li>
	<li>JavaScript Interviews Exposed (series)</li>
	<li>Lazy Enhancement</li>
	<li>JavaScript video subtitle</li>
	<li>JavaScript video timeline marks</li>
	<li>Deleting a removed node from DOM</li>
</ul>

Stay tuned!
